## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

You also need to set up redis storage and blob storage for saving the letters and their assets. Here is a setup process if you deploy this on Vercel:

1. Create a new project on Vercel
2. Create a new Redis database and Blob storage on Vercel
3. Connect the Redis database and Blob storage to your project
4. Pull the environment variables from your connected Vercel project
5. Allow displaying assets from your Blob storage domain in your app by modifying the `next.config.ts` file

```
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'my-blob-store.public.blob.vercel-storage.com',
        port: '',
      },
    ],
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```
